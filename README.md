# DOML-GO
GO version of DOML.  
It is built natively to improve the speed and usability of the application in comparison to a C wrapper library.

## Forewarning
I've only just recently picked up GO, and while I do have lots of experience with similar languages (C#, C++, Swift, Python),
GO does seem to have quite a few differences, and especially around concurrency I'm inexperience with GO.
Thus probably expect weird syntax things, and probably 'wrong' code in comparison to what the standard is, I'll try to fix any issues
and well if it bothers you enough maybe you'll grab a fork and make the changes yourself, which I'm sure will be better than if I did it :).

## Benchmarks
I'll put up some benchmarks when I'm actually happy with the program.
